# Hello
I am a senior computer science undergrad at the University of Delaware. My specialty is software engineering and full-stack development, though I've also worked in systems programming, data science/machine learning, and human-computer interaction.

## What I'm working on
- Currently interning at **WTS Paradigm** as a software developer :)
- In the fall, I will be taking **Computer Vision**, **Data Mining**, and **Computer Science Senior Design**
- Some other data science projects on the side

## Experience
**Languages/Frameworks:** C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, C, C++, SQL, NodeJS, React, Bootstrap, Express, .NET, ASP.NET, Unity

**Tools/Misc**: Windows, Linux, Git, GitHub, Subversion, MongoDB, REST APIs, Swagger, FloodElement, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, Bash, Jenkins

**Coursework**: Data Structures, Assembly & Machine Organization, Software Engineering, Automata Theory, Logic for Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Technical Writing, Calculus, Discrete Math, Statistics, Linear Algebra

## Projects
### [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2)
Written in TypeScript, a Discord bot for the University of Delaware Computer Science Department's official Discord server. Many features including the abilities to ask private questions related to coursework and create polls in chat. It is used by 3000+ students and 30+ professors at the university.

### [SpeedySolvers](https://github.com/sbrugel/SpeedySolvers)
A full-stack React app where users aim to solve math problem sets as fast as possible; features a problem set creation interface, leaderboards, and a tutoring forum. 2024 HenHacks Hackathon submission, worked on with a four-person team in 24 hours.

### [Journal Manager](https://github.com/sbrugel/Journal-Manager)
Written in C#, a Windows Forms application that allows the user to write journal entries, save them locally, and view them later. Features basic rich text formatting (using tags).

### [Maze Solver & Classroom Allocator](https://github.com/sbrugel/python-ai-stuff)
Two AI-centric projects written in Python! One solves mazes using the A* algorithm, finding the optimal path where any solution exists. The other allocates classes to classrooms of varying sizes using the AC-3 algorithm.
