# Hello World! My name is Simon.
I'm a computer science enthusiast who also majors in the subject at the University of Delaware, currently concentrating in Artifical Intelligence & Robotics. My eventual goal is to work in software development and/or AI - two areas that catch my interest and truly fascinate me. 

In particular, I enjoy creating GUI-based utilities (mainly using the .NET framework), web applications/pages, and much more - including Discord bot development using NodeJS.

## My current programming/markdown languages
In no particular order:
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript (and TypeScript)
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- NodeJS

I'm always happy to learn more languages and applications of programming!
