## Projects
### [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2)
Written in TypeScript, this is a Discord bot for the University of Delaware Computer Science Department's official Discord server. It has many features, including the abilities to ask private questions related to coursework and create polls in chat. It is used by 2500+ students and 25+ professors at the university.

### [GO-DE](https://github.com/sbrugel/go-de)
Written in JavaScript + React/Express, this is a full-stack, social-media like web application where registered users aim to visit all Delaware landmarks, sharing their activity with followers and being able to track their progress. I created it with [Laura Lewis](https://github.com/craftablescience) and [Paul Kearney](https://github.com/paulke2) in 24 hours (14-16 not including sleep!) for the 2023 HenHacks Hackathon - it was a lot of fun! You can read more about it on the project's [DevPost page.](https://devpost.com/software/go-de)

### [Journal Manager](https://github.com/sbrugel/Journal-Manager)
Written in C#, a Windows Forms application that allows the user to write journal entries, save them locally, and view them later. Features basic rich text formatting (using tags).

### [Maze Solver & Classroom Allocator](https://github.com/sbrugel/python-ai-stuff)
Two AI-centric projects written in Python! One solves mazes using the A* algorithm, finding the optimal path where any solution exists. The other allocates classes to classrooms of varying sizes using the AC-3 algorithm.
