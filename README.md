# Hello
I'm a sophomore at the University of Delaware, pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science (with a focus in Artifical Intelligence & Robotics).

## My experiences
**Proficient in C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS.** I also have experience with C, C++, Bootstrap, React, and the Unity game engine.

## What I'm working on
**Currently learning:** Logic for Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems

In my spare time, I'm working on different projects in C++, C#, Python and JS/React

I'm also a teaching assistant for CISC181, an introductory Java/OOP class

## My main projects
### [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2)
Written in TypeScript, this is a Discord bot for the University of Delaware Computer Science Department's official Discord server. It has many features, including the abilities to ask private questions related to coursework and create polls in chat. It is used by 2500+ students and 25+ professors at the university.

### [SEPTA Delay History](https://github.com/sbrugel/septa-delay-history)
Written in JavaScript + React/Express and TypeScript, this is a full-stack web application that displays delay data (average/mean/extremities) of SEPTA regional rail services. The app has a backend that connects to a database, a frontend that displays the information based on user queries, and a supplemental script that scrapes the SEPTA API every 15 minutes, posting delay data for each SEPTA service to the database.

### [Journal Manager](https://github.com/sbrugel/Journal-Manager)
Written in C#, a Windows Forms application that allows the user to write journal entries, save them locally, and view them later. Features basic rich text formatting (using tags).

### [img2pi](https://github.com/sbrugel/img2pi)
Written in Python and C, these two scripts take an image, pixelate it down to 8x8, and displays it on an 8 tile by 8 tile Sense Hat of a Raspberry Pi.
