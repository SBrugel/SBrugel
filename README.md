# Hello World! My name is Simon.
I'm a computer science enthusiast who also majors in the subject at the University of Delaware, currently concentrating in Artifical Intelligence & Robotics. My eventual goal is to work in software development and/or AI.

In particular, I enjoy creating GUI-based utilities (mainly using the .NET framework), web applications/pages, and much more - including Discord bot development using NodeJS. Currently, aside from personal projects and coursework, my main work is development of [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2), a Discord bot for the University of Delaware's Computer Science Department's Discord server which has features to allow students to ask anon/private questions regarding their computer science classes, users to set reminders for themselves, and much more.

## My current programming/markdown languages
In no particular order:
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript (and TypeScript)
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- NodeJS

## My main projects
### [SEPTA Checker](https://github.com/sbrugel/SEPTA-Checker)
Written in JavaScript, a Discord bot made in JavaScript that intakes user-specified SEPTA train numbers, and tracks them actively, showing their delays (in minutes) in a Discord channel.

### [Journal Manager](https://github.com/sbrugel/Journal-Manager)
Written in C#, a Windows Forms application that allows the user to write journal entries, save them locally, and view them later. Features basic rich text formatting (using tags).

### [img2pi](https://github.com/sbrugel/img2pi)
Written in Python and C, these two scripts take an image, pixelate it down to 8x8, and displays it on an 8 tile by 8 tile Sense Hat of a Raspberry Pi.

### *I have many more projects publicly available here - feel free to take a look around!*
