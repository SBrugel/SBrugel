# Hello
I'm a sophomore at the University of Delaware, pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science (with a focus in Artifical Intelligence & Robotics).

## My experiences
**Proficient in C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS.** I also have experience with C, C++, Bootstrap, React, Express.js, and the Unity game engine.

## What I'm working on
**Currently learning:** Logic for Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems

In my spare time, I'm working on different projects in C++, C#, Python and JS/React

I'm also a teaching assistant for CISC181, an introductory Java/OOP class

## My main projects
### [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2)
Written in TypeScript, this is a Discord bot for the University of Delaware Computer Science Department's official Discord server. It has many features, including the abilities to ask private questions related to coursework and create polls in chat. It is used by 2500+ students and 25+ professors at the university.

### [GO-DE](https://github.com/sbrugel/go-de)
Written in JavaScript + React/Express, this is a full-stack, social-media like site where registered users aim to visit all Delaware landmarks, sharing their activity with followers and being able to track their progress. I created it with Brendan Lewis and Paul Kearney in 24 hours (14-16 not including sleep!) for the 2023 HenHacks Hackathon - it was a lot of fun! You can read more about it on the project's [DevPost page.](https://devpost.com/software/go-de)

### [Journal Manager](https://github.com/sbrugel/Journal-Manager)
Written in C#, a Windows Forms application that allows the user to write journal entries, save them locally, and view them later. Features basic rich text formatting (using tags).

### [img2pi](https://github.com/sbrugel/img2pi)
Written in Python and C, these two scripts take an image, pixelate it down to 8x8, and displays it on an 8 tile by 8 tile Sense Hat of a Raspberry Pi.
