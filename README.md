Salut, I'm Simon. I like to write programs that solve problems, whether it's something to make life a bit less tedious or to automate an otherwise extreme task, along other things. My main languages are above, but I'm more than willing to learn more!

You'll see many of my personal and academic projects here, varying in purpose and language. Some are meant for public use while others are experimental or for learning purposes. Feel free to take a dig around.

More information about me (mainly in the general sense) is available [here](https://sbrugel.github.io/about-me.html).
