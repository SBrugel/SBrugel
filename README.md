# Hello
I am a senior computer science undergrad at the University of Delaware. My specialty is software engineering and full-stack development, though I've also worked in systems programming, data science/machine learning, and human-computer interaction.

## What I'm working on
- Taking Computer Vision, Data Mining, and Senior Design at UD
- Working on certifications and side projects in data science and other fields

## Experience
**Languages/Frameworks:** C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, C, C++, ASM, SQL, NodeJS, React, Bootstrap, Express, Flask, Tkinter, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, .NET, ASP.NET, Unity

**Tools/Misc**: Windows, Linux, Git, GitHub, Subversion, Microsoft Azure, MongoDB, REST APIs, Swagger, Flood Element, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, Bash, Jenkins

**Coursework**: : Data Structures, Software Engineering, Automata Theory, Logic for Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, Databases, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Technical Writing, Calculus, Discrete Math, Statistical Methods, Linear Algebra

## Projects
### [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2)
Written in TypeScript, a Discord bot for the University of Delaware Computer Science Department's official Discord server. Many features including the abilities to ask private questions related to coursework and create polls in chat. It is used by 3000+ students and 30+ professors at the university.

### [SpeedySolvers](https://github.com/sbrugel/SpeedySolvers)
A full-stack React app where users aim to solve math problem sets as fast as possible; features a problem set creation interface, leaderboards, and a tutoring forum. 2024 HenHacks Hackathon submission, worked on with a four-person team in 24 hours.

### [OS Simulation](https://github.com/sbrugel/cisc361-project)
Written in C++, this simulates an operating system, handling processes scheduling and device/resource requests efficiently, avoiding deadlocks and employing different scheduling techniques like round robin.

### [Maze Solver & Classroom Allocator](https://github.com/sbrugel/python-ai-stuff)
Two AI-centric projects written in Python! One solves mazes using the A* algorithm, finding the optimal path where any solution exists. The other allocates classes to classrooms of varying sizes using the AC-3 algorithm.
