# Hello
I'm a Computer Science B.S. major at the University of Delaware, currently concentrating in Artifical Intelligence & Robotics. I enjoy programming and strive to learn as much as I can at every opportunity.

## My experiences
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=sbrugel&layout=compact)](https://github.com/sbrugel/github-readme-stats)

**Experienced in ** C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, NodeJS.
I am also currently learning C, C++, and React.

## My main projects
### [Sage](https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2)
Written in TypeScript, a Discord bot for the University of Delaware's Computer Science Department's Discord server which has features to allow students to ask anon/private questions regarding their computer science classes, users to set reminders for themselves, and much more. It is used by 1500+ students and 20+ professors at the university.

### [SEPTA Checker](https://github.com/sbrugel/SEPTA-Checker)
Written in JavaScript, a Discord bot made in JavaScript that intakes user-specified SEPTA train numbers, and tracks them actively, showing their delays (in minutes) in a Discord channel.

### [Journal Manager](https://github.com/sbrugel/Journal-Manager)
Written in C#, a Windows Forms application that allows the user to write journal entries, save them locally, and view them later. Features basic rich text formatting (using tags).

### [img2pi](https://github.com/sbrugel/img2pi)
Written in Python and C, these two scripts take an image, pixelate it down to 8x8, and displays it on an 8 tile by 8 tile Sense Hat of a Raspberry Pi.
